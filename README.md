# Emergent phenomena by creating music.

[Working CI build](https://peaceful-pasteur-906c96.netlify.app)

## How to use.

The bottom bars show the beats of music the player will produce for each colour channel.
Press the "Select this rhythm" button and then on the white area above to select a tone and volume for that channel.

Press on the beat bars to select a beat that you think will sound nice like.

Press play and music emerges.

Adjust the "spookiness" and "speed" to get different effects. (You may need to restart playback to hear this kind of change.)
